### Description of Dataset ###
The dataset contains continental and country-specific records of CO₂ emissions from fossil fuels, deforestation, and other sources. It includes key metrics such as per capita emissions, total emissions, and GDP per CO₂ emissions, spanning several decades. 

### Why This Dataset was Selected ###
This dataset was selected because it provides a comprehensive view of CO₂ emissions, making it an ideal choice for creating charts that highlight critical environmental issues. Graphing this data is extremely meaningful as it allows users to observe long-term trends, such as the rise or decline in global emissions or the comparison of CO2 levels in countries. These charts can help identify patterns and potential turning points in emission levels over time, as well as give insight into which countries contribute the most to global CO2 emissions. This encourages discussions about sustainability and the steps needed to address climate change.
